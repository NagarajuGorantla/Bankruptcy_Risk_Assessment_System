## 📌 Overview
The **Bankruptcy Risk Assessment System** is an end-to-end machine learning solution designed to predict the probability of business bankruptcy based on key financial and operational risk indicators.

This project demonstrates a **production-oriented data science workflow** — from data preprocessing and model training to deployment via an interactive web application — with strong emphasis on **business interpretability and decision support**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Business failures lead to major financial losses for lenders, investors, and stakeholders.  
Early identification of bankruptcy risk enables:

- Proactive risk mitigation  
- Smarter credit and investment decisions  
- Improved financial stability  

This system classifies firms as **financially stable or high bankruptcy risk** using structured financial indicators.

---

## 🧠 Solution Approach
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Feature-driven risk modeling  
- Binary classification using Logistic Regression  
- Model persistence and inference  
- Deployment via Streamlit for real-time predictions
